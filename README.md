# Calculator
Draft of a calculator program made during 2nd semester at UnB. It uses Reverse Polonese Notation to read and calculate mathematical expressions.

Language: C

There are some bugs yet to be fixed.

the tofloat argument seems to fail sometimes, therefore some numbers cannot be read as decimals.
It doesn't work with expressions containing letters.
The code and comments need improvements and the variables needs to be rewrited following a pattern.
